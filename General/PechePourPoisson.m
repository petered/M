function [T tvec]=PechePourPoisson(rate,dt,order)
% Rate-Varying Poisson-Process generator.
% 
% T=PechePourPoisson(rate);
% T=PechePourPoisson(rate,dt);
% [T tvec]=PechePourPoisson(rate,dt);
%
% Example:
% rate=conv(randn(1,10000),ones(1,1000),'same'); 
% [T t]=PechePourPoisson(rate,.001);
% plot(t,rate); 
% addline(T); addline(0,'h'); % You may not have the addline function
%
% This function spits out a poisson process with a rate that can vary with
% time.  Each sample of the "rate" vector is considered to be the beginning
% of a time bin of width dt.  The number of events occurring in each bin is
% sampled from a Poisson Distribution.  The timing of each event within the
% bin is then randomized.
%
% Note: You can easily specify a constant-rate process running for a
% certain time by just making "rate" a scalar rate and setting dt to your
% desired time span.
%
% Inputs    Description
% "rate"    Vector representing the rate as a function of time.  Negative
%           rates are interpreted as zero rates.
% ("dt")    Optional scalar defining the time resolution of the rate
%           vector.  If neglected, dt=1, and the rate is interpreted as
%           meaning "events per time-sample".  If dt is set, rate will be
%           scaled by the value of dt.  eg, say you want 90events/s, where
%           the rate vector represents the spiking rate as a function of 
%           time with millisecond resolution.  Then dt=0.001, and 
%           rate(i)=90, where i is the particular instant with a 90event/s 
%           rate.
%("order")  Optional order of the gamma-distribution of inter-event 
%           intervals.  Order defaults to 1, making it a poisson-process.
%           Higher orders make it a (gamma process)?  Order is implemented
%           by first multiplying the rate function by order, then keeping
%           only every order'th event.
%
% Outputs   Description
% "T"       Vector of event times.  The first sample of "rate" is 
%           considered to be time 0.  If dt is specified, times will be
%           scaled accordingly.
% "tvec"    If you're too lazy to make your own time vector for your rate
%           vector, this function can optionally do it for you.
